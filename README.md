## Design Considerations Supported by External Sources

Our choices, especially in terms of color palette and interactive elements, are backed by research. For instance, blue's calming effect on users, which encourages focus, is supported by "The Influence of Color on Memory Performance: A Review" (Dzulkifli). Similarly, the importance of interactivity in e-learning platforms, as highlighted in our survey, finds support in "The Role of Interactivity in Web-Based Educational Systems" (Sun).
